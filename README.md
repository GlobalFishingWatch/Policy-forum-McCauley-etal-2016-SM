# McCauley et al. 2016 Supplimental Material

Supplemental information, code, and underlying data for the MS: Douglas J. McCauley, Paul Woods, Brian Sullivan, Bjorn Bergman, Caroline Jablonicky, Aaron Roan, Michael Hirshfield, Kristina Boerder, and Boris Worm (2016). Ending hide and seek at sea.

Description of files:

Fishing_score_algorithm.py – python code used to determine mechanics of algorithm used to assign fishing scores to processed AIS data as described in supplementary materials section 4.

MMSI_list_Fig_S7_speed_filter.csv - number of fishing days /month, calculated using the speed filter for each identified vessel (based on Maritime Mobile Service Identity number (MMSI); described in supplementary materials section 2) using S-AIS data in 2013 for 9 WCPFC cells.

MMSI_list_Fig_S7_fishing_score.csv - number of fishing days /month, calculated using the fishing score algorithm (described in supplementary materials section 4) for each identified vessel (based on MMSI) using S-AIS data in 2013 for 9 WCPFC cells.

MMSI_list_Fig_S7_vessel_presence.csv - number of days /month each identified fishing vessel (based on MMSI) using S-AIS data was present in 2013 for 9 WCPFC cells.

MMSI_list_all_fishing_days.csv - Master list of all MMSIs (individual vessels) that were identified to exhibit putative fishing behavior in our study areas. Determination of fishing behavior made using speed filter, as described section 4 of supplementary materials. Data here is reported in Figs. 1A-B, S2, S8.

Figure_raster_data folder contains 4 folders:

1a - original composite raster file (.asc file type) used to create Fig. 1A (number of fishing days for each grid cell) + 169  individual raster data files for each unique MMSI identified to be putatively fishing in area of interest. Each file denotes the number of fishing days/grid cell.

1b - original composite raster file (.asc file type) used to create Fig. 1B (number of fishing days for each grid cell) + 210  individual raster data files for each unique MMSI identified to be putatively fishing in area of interest. Each file denotes the number of fishing days/grid cell.

S2 – original composite raster file (.asc file type) used to create Fig. 1A (number of fishing days for each grid cell) + 152  individual raster data files for each unique MMSI identified to be putatively fishing in area of interest. Each file denotes the number of fishing days/grid cell.

S8 - original composite raster file (.asc file type) used to create Fig. S8 (number of fishing days for each grid cell) + 132  individual raster data files for each unique MMSI identified to be putatively fishing in area of interest. Each file denotes the number of fishing days/grid cell.
